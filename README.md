# Lanky and Tiny

##  How to Set Up

Clone this repo to your local machine (You can find information on how to do that [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

Open the project folder in unity 2022.3.6f1 (or higher)

## Guidlines

Try to make a branch before you make any changes, then make a pull request from that branch. Try to use squash when merging the pull request rather than just plain merge so it's easier to see when features are added

Be nice? I think Idk this is my first project of this kind so try not to make it impossible for everyone here.

## Misc

I think isues might be a good way for us to manage a project and see who does what, but Im very open to suggestions.
